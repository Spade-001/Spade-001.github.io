Welcome to Week 8!!! After making significant progress with the game controls last week, in this week, my team and I were able to implement and calibrate the controls with the different 
scenes according to the person using the headset, due to the complexity involved in the controls and how the controls are different to each wearer due to the differences in people's psyche.
We also had to do a pitch commercial video where we had to act as though we were selling our product(the game), to an actual company, where the video had to detail things about the game 
such as a person playing it using the gyroscope controls for example, the development of the game, e.t.c. We also had to get started on the paper we need to submit to the program supervisors,
detailing all our approaches and studies used in this project. Grateful for another successful week!!!
