## About My Mentor(s)

My mentor and supervisor for this research program is Dr. Naja Mack, who is a researcher and professor at Morgan State University whose work focuses on a plethora of things, such as the project I have for this summer regarding Brain-Computer Interfaces, as well as Human-Robot Interaction. Her work aims to leverage novel neurophysiological sensing technologies, software engineering, and robotics to create tools and applications that support the exploration of Brain-Robot Interaction. During the CEAMLS institute, she proved to be quite the motivator and mentor for getting things done and making sure that any and all required tasks were covered. She gave me and my team completely honest feedback and recommendations, which all helped a lot in the completion of my assigned project this summer 2024.
