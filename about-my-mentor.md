## About My Mentor(s)

My mentor and supervisor for this research program is Dr. Naja Mack, who is a researcher and professor at Morgan State University whose work focuses on a plethora of things, such as the project I have for this summer regarding Brain-Computer Interfaces, as well as Human-Robot Interaction. Her work aims to leverage novel neurophysiological sensing technologies, software engineering, and robotics to create tools and applications that support the exploration of Brain-Robot Interaction.
