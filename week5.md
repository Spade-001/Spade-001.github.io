Project prototype week!!! This week, my teammates and I were tasked with two things, which
was creating a Figma mockup of what our game should look like(the player, the game environment, 
what a gameplay should look like), and to create a working code demo that will be later 
implemeted into the game. The whole team was split into two teams of two to handle the above 
mentioned tasks separately, and I was on the team that handled the latter task. In that task, 
we were to create code that handles the controls of the game by detecting the player's focus 
level, and to enable gyroscope as well(which handles game character movement based on head 
rotations/motion). Exciting week as usual, looking forward to the next one!!!
