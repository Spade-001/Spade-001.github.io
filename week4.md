This week was a week full of research and presentations!!! To start, we rounded up our literature review presentations from the 
prior week and the purpose of them was to bolster and enhance our knowledge of what our project is all about and our task 
requirements for it. We also had to create wireframes(an empty, colorless canvas) for any game ideas that we thought of and more 
importantly, how we could incorporate BCIs into them, specifically, how people with lost limbs could still have the same amount of 
fun experience a normal person would by simply just using their minds and a few more actions like blinking/moving their heads to 
control the game & its characters instead. After that, we were required to create the mockup version of the wireframe, which is 
basically a colored/eventful version of the wireframe. And that's a wrap for Week 4! Absolutely looking forward to the next week...
