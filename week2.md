In this week, my team members and I were required to complete all the Unity's Create with Code tasks. In the tasks, I 
learned more about the way physics work in a game(such as how objects in a game move, repel & collide with each other), 
how gameObjects interact with each other, and how we coummumicate between scripts/classes. During meeting sessions with other 
teams from different projects, we explored a little about how we can use our brain waves to control devices such as drones 
for example, based on certain physical actions like chewing, or thoughts. This activity gave me an idea of what my future 
tasks in this project should look like in the duration of this research program. 
Its definitely been an exciting and fun week so far, and i'm looking forward to delving deeper into my project!!!
