Welcome to Week 9!!! Now that my team and I are rounding up our project's development phase, in this week, the task was to obtain 
live feedback from people who were willing to test out the game. The purpose of the testing is to observe how the gameplay changes according
to whoever's wearing the muse headset, based off of factors such as that person head-size, their psyche, and how they liked & felt about the 
game in general. It was a productive process, as we got to learn a couple more things based on the feedback we received.
