Welcome to the 10th and final week!!! Now that the project for this summer program has been completed, there's not much to talk about 
at this point, except for a few things, such as rounding up product testing, finalizing our final research papers, and most of all 
presenting the work done at the final symposium to the panel of the program's supervisors and every other participant involved as a 
researcher as well. It's been quite a journey since the beginning of this internship up till this point, lots of highs and lows where I'd felt
that I couldn't meet up with the expected task requirements involved, but I'm glad that it all worked out in the end. My thanks to those
supervising this program for making it even happen to begin with, my mentors who guided me along the way, and my wonderful teammates for
being so cooperative. Cheers!!!
