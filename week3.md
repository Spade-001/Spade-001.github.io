During this week, we did more research on our project topics by studying more articles, digesting and understanding 
the information in each article. We also had to learn a lot more about Figma by creating prototype pages that were 
meant to recreate the UI design of our chosen app(mine was Twitter, now named X) by taking screenshots of the pages from 
our phones. At the latter part of the week, we also went on a field trip to Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics 
laboratory to get more insights on our research topics. And the last but not the least activity was building MBot robots
for CodeBears, where we use them in teaching elementary to middle schoolers how to code. A very excting week indeed!!!
