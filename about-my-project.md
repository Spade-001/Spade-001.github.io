## About My Project

Mind Mastery

Problem: There is a lack of reasearch focusing on exploring ways to build gaming software that creates  a seamless, reliable, and efficient communication pathways between the human brain and external devices for 3D gaming. 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Accurately capture brain signals non-invasively or invasively, while minimizing noise and ensuring consistent quality.
  - Interpreting the complex, multi-dimensional brain signals in real-time to translate them into meaningful commands or actions.
  - Using the interpretations to ensure smooth control on the game characters from the player. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of this research program, where it will focus on the findings of my research and ways on how they could be possibly implemented.
