## About Me
Hello!!! My name is Maxwell Adeniji, currently, I am currently a transfer-Junior at Morgan State University, located in Baltimore, Maryland. I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Science & Systems(INSS). My expected graduation date is in December 2025. Although I'm an INSS major, my background is in Computer Science(specifically in data science & software engineering). My interests lie in creating sophisticated software/applications, and using AI to explore the fields of cryptocurrency or in other words, the blockchain, hence my background experiences in those two fields.
