During the first week, I met with my project supervisor(Dr. Mack) and my graduate mentors to discuss the project 
that I and my fellow team members would be working on, and gained an understanding of what the project outcome should be as well. 
My mentors also explained to me what our project, "Brain-Computer Interface in Game Development (BCI)", is all about, the basic project prerequisites we as team members ought to be knowledgeable about before starting off the project.

The tasks in the prerequisites for this particular project were very exciting(based on "Create With Code" from Unity); apart from basic computer science fundamentals such as operators and conditional statements, I also learned quite a bit about developing games and how people control players in the game, learned the basic physics behind game development as well such as how gravity works in a game, how items in games collide and interact with each other, how all 3-dimensional planes work and how they affect player movement, and so on. 

Overall it was a very exciting week, the only minor issues I had were with the assets and file dependencies, but with the help of my mentors, they got sorted swiftly and smoothly.
